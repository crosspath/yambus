# Yambus

This package generates functions for accessing application routes (e.g.
`create_account_path`) and performing requests to the application (e.g.
`create_account`).

See installations steps and use cases in documentation for
[core functionality][1] (package `@crosspath/yambus`).

If you want to start quickly using this library, take one of its adapters:

- [adapter for Axios][2] (package `@crosspath/yambus-axios`)
- [adapter for `fetch`][3] (package `@crosspath/yambus-fetch`)
